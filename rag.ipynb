It also has links to research in cognitive science, psychology, philosophy and\\nmaths (especially logic). Within CS, it relates to formal language theory, compiler techniques, theorem proving, ma-\\nchine learning and human-computer interaction.

These subareas loosely\\ncorrespond to some of the standard subdivisions of linguistics:\\n1. Morphology: the structure of words. For instance, unusually can be thought of as composed of a pre\\x02x un-, a\\nstem usual, and an af\\x02x -ly. composed is compose plus the in\\x03ectional af\\x02x -ed: a spelling rule means we end\\nup with composed rather than composeed. Morphology will be discussed in lecture 2.\\n2. Syntax: the way words are used to form phrases. e.g., it is part of English syntax that a determiner such as\\nthe will come before a noun, and also that determiners are obligatory with certain singular nouns. Formal and\\ncomputational aspects of syntax will be discussed in lectures 3, 4 and 5.\"),\n",

Compositional and lexical\\nsemantics is discussed in lecture 6.\\n4. Pragmatics: meaning in context.

It explains that discourse relations can be represented as a binary branching tree structure, where some relationships, such as Explanation, have a main phrase (nucleus) and a subsidiary phrase (satellite) that can be removed without losing coherence. This can be exploited in summarization. However, other relationships, like Narration, give equal weight to both elements, making summarization more challenging. The document also provides an overview of the NLP field, its subareas, and methodologies, and outlines the structure of a course that covers these topics in more detail. \n",
